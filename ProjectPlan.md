## Student Evaluation

# *What Have I Learned That I Am Using In My Project?*

1. **HTML** 

    * Simple, but it is the foundation of my code. It all starts with a basic HTML page.

2. **CSS**

    * CSS is built into all my components. It provides functionality, helps make the page look better and makes the items align correctly.

3. **Flexbox** 

    * I used Flexbox to help with creating a drop-down nav menu.

4. **JavaScript**

    * JavaScript is used in a few of the components to help with Vue.js, to import and export components. It's also heavily used in the Tic Tac Toe game.

5. **AI Logic** 

    * AI Logic is used in the Tic Tac Toe Game.

6. **Node.js**

    * Used to help test and build the project.

7. **Vue.js**

    * Used to break the project into components, also used for it's two-way binding.

8. **Vue Router**

    * Used to change the project into a single page app.

9. **Firebase**

    * Firebase is used to host the application. It provides Authentication, Cloud Storage, Analytics and a Realtime Database.

# *How Has This Affected My View of Coding?*

Learning all these subjects has helped my visualize what actually goes into creating a web page or web app. Coding is a complicated process, but due to the internet one can learn a lot on their own.

# *What Kind of Effort Did I Expend?*

I spent many hours coding and creating this project. The most effort would have been debugging and figuring out what I did wrong and fixing it. It's a hard task to create a fully functioning application that does something useful and works correctly.
